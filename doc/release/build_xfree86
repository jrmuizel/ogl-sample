    OpenGL 1.2.1 Sample Implementation Build Instructions for XFree86

DIRECTORY STRUCTURE

    (This section, as well as step (2) below, only apply if you're
    starting with a tarball in X tree structure. Otherwise (e.g. if
    you're following instructions in $TOPDIR/README.1st), you should
    have already copied SI files into the X tree.)

    The tar file containing the SI extracts into the following directory
    hierarchy:

    xc				    Additions to XFree86 source tree
    xc/doc			    Man pages and specifications
    xc/include/GL		    Client header files
    xc/lib/GL			    Client library source code
    xc/programs/Xserver/include/GL  Server header files
    xc/programs/Xserver/GL	    Server source code
    xc/programs/Xserver/GL/opengl   Server OpenGL renderer

    Everything under the 'xc' directory drops into the corresponding
    location in the XFree86 3.3.5 source tree.


SUPPORTED PLATFORMS

    As distributed, the SI builds against an XFree86 3.3.5 source tree. We
    will migrate to supporting the next major XFree86 release (4.0) when
    that becomes available. There may also be a change in the location
    of the client and server GLX and GL directories within the xc/
    hierarchy.

    We build on a system running SGI Linux 1.1 (kernel version 2.2.10,
    otherwise similar to Red Hat Linux 6.0) with the standard GNU
    toolset provided by Red Hat. The SI has been tested running as part
    of the XF86_SVGA server in 8 and 16 bit depths.

    The GLw widget has not been tested on Linux due to lack of a Motif
    implementation, but it has been tested on Irix.


BUILDING

    1) Set the environment variable XTOPDIR to point to the top of the
       XFree86 3.3.5 source tree (e.g. $XTOPDIR/xc should exist and contain
       the top-level XFree86 Imakefile). Set the environment variable
       RELEASEDIR to point to the directory containing the SI tar file
       (1.2.1.##.tgz, where '##' is the latest released version of the SI).

    2) Change directory to $XTOPDIR, then uncompress and untar the SI. Files
       will be extracted directly into the correct locations in the XFree86
       tree:

	% cd $XTOPDIR
	% tar xzf $RELEASEDIR/1.2.1.##.tgz

	Or, if not using GNU tar:

	% cd $XTOPDIR
	% gzip -d $RELEASDIR/1.2.1.##.tgz | tar xf -

    3) If you have not already done so, read $XTOPDIR/README.OPENGL.

    4) Add the following definitions to $XTOPDIR/xc/config/cf/host.def:

	    #define GlxModule NO
	    #define BuildGlxExt YES
	    #define GlxStaticServerLib GL/LibraryTargetName(dixGL) \
				       GL/opengl/LibraryTargetName(GLcore)
	    #define GlxStaticServerDir GL

	Setting BuildGlxExt causes the build to descend into the GLX client
	(xc/lib/GL) and server (xc/programs/Xserver/GL) directories and
	build libraries there.

	If you're not familiar with XFree86 builds: you'll probably
	want to turn off building all the servers except the one
	specific to your hardware. For example, our reference board uses
	the XF86_SVGA server, so we put the following in host.def:

	    #define XF86SVGAServer	    YES
	    #define XF86VGA16Server	    NO
	    #define XF86VGA16DualServer     NO
	    #define XF86MonoServer	    NO
	    #define XF86MonoDualServer	    NO
	    #define XF86S3Server	    NO
	    #define XF86S3VServer	    NO
	    #define XF86I8514Server	    NO
	    #define XF86Mach8Server	    NO
	    #define XF86Mach32Server	    NO
	    #define XF86Mach64Server	    NO
	    #define XF86P9000Server	    NO
	    #define XF86AGXServer	    NO
	    #define XF86W32Server	    NO
	    #define XF86I128Server	    NO
	    #define XF86GLINTServer	    NO
	    #define XF86FBDevServer	    NO
	    #define XprtServer		    NO
	    #define XnestServer		    NO
	    #define XVirtualFramebufferServer NO

	Doing this will speed up the build process considerably.

    5) Building the GLw widget requires Motif, which most Linux systems
       do not have preinstalled; therefore it is disabled by default. If
       you have Motif installed and wish to build the GLw widget, add
       the following to host.def:

	#define BuildGlw YES

    6) Make the following change to xc/programs/Xserver/Imakefile. This
       will cause the server GLX library to be built when BuildGlxExt is
       defined and the non-stub Glx library is being built:

	51c51
	<	  GLXDIR =
	---
	>	  GLXDIR = GlxStaticServerDir

    7) Make the following change to xc/lib/Imakefile. This will cause
       the client GLX library to be built when BuildGlxExt is defined.

	59a60,63
	> #if BuildGlxExt
	> GLXLIBDIR = GL
	> #endif
	>
	78c82
	< SUBDIRS = $(BERKDIR) xtrans $(LINTSUBDIRS) $(FONTSUBDIR)
	---
	> SUBDIRS = $(BERKDIR) xtrans $(LINTSUBDIRS) $(FONTSUBDIR) $(GLXLIBDIR)

    8) You should be able to build the XFree86 server and client
       libraries normally at this point by descending to $XTOPDIR/xc and
       'make World'.

    9) The conformance tests (included if you're an OpenGL licensee) and
       sample programs are not built by 'make World'. You can build them
       as follows:

	% cd $XTOPDIR/xc/test/GL/conform
	% imake -I$XTOPDIR/xc/config/cf -DTOPDIR=$XTOPDIR/xc
	% make Makefiles
	% make

	% cd $XTOPDIR/xc/contrib/GL
	% imake -I$XTOPDIR/xc/config/cf -DTOPDIR=$XTOPDIR/xc
	% make Makefiles
	% make
